# Cloud Storage Server

## Intro
This project involved developing a distributed application that required extensive knowledge of sockets
programming, Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), scale-out techniques, networked storage, load balancing,
fault tolerance, and cloud computing. The goal was to design a system that could effectively handle
scalability and reliability challenges in a distributed environment.

## Usage

1. Run your server using this:

```shell
go run cmd/SurfstoreServerExec/main.go -s <service> -p <port> -l -d (BlockStoreAddr*)
```

Here, `service` should be one of three values: meta, block, or both. This is used to specify the service provided by the server. `port` defines the port number that the server listens to (default=8080). `-l` configures the server to only listen on localhost. `-d` configures the server to output log statements. Lastly, (BlockStoreAddr\*) is the BlockStore address that the server is configured with. If `service=both` then the BlockStoreAddr should be the `ip:port` of this server.

2. Run your client using this:

```shell
go run cmd/SurfstoreClientExec/main.go -d <meta_addr:port> <base_dir> <block_size>
```

## Examples:

```shell
go run cmd/SurfstoreServerExec/main.go -s both -p 8081 -l localhost:8081
```

This starts a server that listens only to localhost on port 8081 and services both the BlockStore and MetaStore interface.

```shell
Run the commands below on separate terminals (or nodes)
> go run cmd/SurfstoreServerExec/main.go -s block -p 8081 -l
> go run cmd/SurfstoreServerExec/main.go -s meta -l localhost:8081
```

The first line starts a server that services only the BlockStore interface and listens only to localhost on port 8081. The second line starts a server that services only the MetaStore interface, listens only to localhost on port 8080, and references the BlockStore we created as the underlying BlockStore. (Note: if these are on separate nodes, then you should use the public ip address and remove `-l`)

3. From a new terminal (or a new node), run the client using the script provided in the starter code (if using a new node, build using step 1 first). Use a base directory with some files in it.

```shell
> mkdir dataA
> cp ~/pic.jpg dataA/
> go run cmd/SurfstoreClientExec/main.go server_addr:port dataA 4096
```

This would sync pic.jpg to the server hosted on `server_addr:port`, using `dataA` as the base directory, with a block size of 4096 bytes.

4. From another terminal (or a new node), run the client to sync with the server. (if using a new node, build using step 1 first)

```shell
> mkdir dataB
> go run cmd/SurfstoreClientExec/main.go server_addr:port dataB 4096
> ls dataB/
pic.jpg index.txt
```

We observe that pic.jpg has been synced to this client.

## Makefile

1. Run both BlockStore and MetaStore servers (**listens to localhost on port 8081**):

```shell
make run-both
```

2. Run BlockStore server (**listens to localhost on port 8081**):

```shell
make run-blockstore
```

3. Run MetaStore server (**listens to localhost on port 8080**):

```shell
make run-metastore
```
